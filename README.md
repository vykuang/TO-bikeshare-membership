1. Bikeshare ridership data - given these features:
    * ride start time
    * duration
    * start station id
    * to-station id
    Can we predict whether the user is a member (annual pass) or casual (short term pass)? Is this an unbalanced dataset? Are there far more members than casual trips logged?
